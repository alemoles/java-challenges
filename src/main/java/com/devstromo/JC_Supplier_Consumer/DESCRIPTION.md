In the following code, the jokerCraziness variable won't be increment at that moment:

`Supplier supplier = () -> jokerCraziness++;`

The same happens in the following statement, the jokerCraziness will not be incremented.

`Consumer consumer = (batmanAttack) ->
System.out.println(batmanAttack + jokerCraziness++);`

The jokerCraziness variable has the value of 0 here, then even still we are invoking the lambda method, we are using the post-increment operator, therefore, the jokerCraziness variable will be only incremented after this execution, therefore the following line will print 0:
System.out.println(jokerCraziness + supplier.get()); 

Finally, we pass 1 to the consumer and add 1 to 1 because again, we are using the post-increment operator. Therefore the result of this accept method will be 2.
consumer.accept(1);

In conclusion, the result of this Java quiz will be:
0
2
