Let's analyze the code, at the first method invocation: `executeAction(1, true);` This method will be invoked: `static void executeAction(Object... o) { ... }` At this line: `executeAction();` This method will be invoked because it's the most specific type: `static void executeAction(StackOverflowError... i) { ... }` At this line: `executeAction(new int[]{1, 2, 3}, 1);` This method will be invoked since we are passing more than one value: `static void executeAction(Object... o) { finalResult += "2";}` Then at those method invocations: `executeAction(1L); executeAction(1);` This method will be invoked because it's easier for the JVM to wide 1L as long and 1 as int to a double than autoboxing them: `static void executeAction(double d) { finalResult += "5";}` Then at this line: `executeAction(Double.valueOf(1));` This method will be invoked because a Double will be widened to Object. `static void executeAction(Object o) { finalResult += "1"; }`
