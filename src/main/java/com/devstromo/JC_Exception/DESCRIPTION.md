Working properly with exceptions is crucial to a high-quality application that users enjoy using. There are 3 main categories of exceptions:
1. Checked Exceptions: used to handle a business requirement or something that is expected and the system can recover from the error.
2. Unchecked Exceptions: used to handle non-functional errors and errors that can be avoided with an if such as ArrayOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException... All of these exceptions inherit from RuntimeException.
3. Error: Very serious errors that shouldn't be handled, instead we should fix the code.

Now that we know what are the main Exception/Error types, let's analyze the code, firstly an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown:

`throw new IllegalArgumentException();`

Then, the logic will go in the inner try statement. Then it will throw a `new FileNotFoundException()`. However, `FileNotFoundException` is not a RuntimeException, instead, it's an Exception.

Therefore, the code execution continues, and the next `Exception` that is thrown is `NullPointerException`. As `NullPointerException` is an `Exception`, we will concatenate "exc" in the `s` variable.

The `finally` clause should be always executed unless there is a `System.exit(0)` or some other edge-cases in the program. Therefore, the next `String` to be concatenated is: "fin". The next finally clause will be also executed concatenating "of".

Inside the last finally clause we are throwing VirtualMachineError("JVMError"), therefore we will concatenate "error" and "JVMError" coming from this Error.

To conclude, the following String will be printed:

"-excfinoferrorJVMError"
