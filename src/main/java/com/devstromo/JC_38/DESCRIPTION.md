Now that you know the main context, itâ€™s time for the Java Challenge!
Let's analyze the code: Runnable `universeImpactRunnable = () -> new ChuckNorris().roundHouseKick();` `Runnable galaxyImpactRunnable = new ChuckNorris()::roundHouseKick;` There is a crucial difference between lambda and method reference. Lambdas are lazy and they will invoke the class constructor only when the method is invoked. On the other hand, with method reference, the constructor will be invoked right away only where the method reference is assigned, not on the method invocation.  So, at this line the constructor is not invoked: Runnable `universeImpactRunnable = () -> new ChuckNorris().roundHouseKick();` And, at this line the constructor is invoked: `Runnable galaxyImpactRunnable = new ChuckNorris()::roundHouseKick; `With that in mind, let's analyze the invoked methods: `universeImpactRunnable.run();`` universeImpactRunnable.run();` With lambdas, every time the run method is invoked, the constructor will be invoked, which means that the numberOfKicks variable will be increased.  So the value from galaxyDamage will be: 12 Then when we invoke those methods: g`alaxyImpactRunnable.run();` 
`galaxyImpactRunnable.run();` The value will be 0 because remember that the constructor will be only invoked one and it was already invoked at the moment of the method reference declaration. By knowing that, and also remembering that the post ++ operator increases a value after the line being processed. Then the values will be: 00 The final result will be then: The galaxy is finished = 1200
