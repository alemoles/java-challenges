There are very important concepts to explore with wrappers, its caching. The JDK developers created a rule that integer numbers from -128 to 127 will be cached. This means that every variable created within this range will be cached, which means that a new object won't be created in the memory heap. When we use the '==' operator we are comparing if the object reference is pointing to the same object. So, in the first comparison the condition will be false because when we use the new operator, we are forcing the creation of a new object in the memory heap. Therefore caching won't work in this case: `e == new Integer(12)` In the second comparison, the 14 number will be cached normally, so this condition will be true: `e == dungeonMasterAge` In the third comparison, we are using here the number 128. Remember that the caching goes only until 127? So, this comparison will be false, this number will continue on the list. In the fourth comparison: `e == prestoAge `The following condition will be true because we are using the equals method that compares the value of the object not the reference of the object: `e.equals(new Integer(22))` Therefore the final result will be: [12, 128]
