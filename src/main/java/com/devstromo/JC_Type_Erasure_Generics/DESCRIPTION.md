Let's analyse the code: `List firstResult = GenericsChallenge3.get(new ArrayList<>(), new String("1"));` In the line above, we are invoking the get method passing an `ArrayList` and a `String` as parameters. 
It's going to work fine, T will be a `String`. Even though we are passing an `ArrayList` without a type, Java will implicitly pass a `String` since the second type is `String`. If the second type is `Integer`, the type of the `ArrayList` would be Integer as well. Then we invoke this other method: `List secondResult = GenericsChallenge3.get("Homer", Double.valueOf("4"));` Note that we are passing two different types to those generic parameters: `public static List get(T type1, R type2) { ... }` The type T will become an Object since we are passing two different types. In order to make T compatible with the different types we are passing, the JVM will transform T into an object so that the elements can be inserted into the `ArrayList`. All the code will run fine and then will print: `1Homer4.0`
