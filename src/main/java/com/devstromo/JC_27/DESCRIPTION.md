Therefore, if you are able to solve this Java Challenge, your understanding of those very important methods will definitely be more clear:

In the first `equals()` method comparison, the result is true because the state of the object is exactly the same, and the `hashcode()` method returns the same value for both objects.

In the second `equals()` method comparison, the `hashcode()` method is being overridden for the `overridenHomer` variable. The name is “Homer” for both Simpson objects, but the hashcode() method returns a different value for overriddenHomer. In this case, the final result from the `equals()` method will be false because the method contains a comparison with the hashcode.

You might notice that the size of the collection is set to hold three `Simpson` objects. Let’s check this in a detailed way.

The first object in the set will be inserted normally:

`new Simpson("Homer");`

The next object will be inserted normally, as well, because it holds a different value from the previous object:

`new Simpson("Marge");`
Finally,  the following Simpson object has the same value as the first object. In this case, the object won’t be inserted:


`set.add(new Simpson("Homer"));`
As we know, the `overridenHomer` object uses a different hashcode value from the normal `Simpson("Homer")` instantiation. For this reason, this element will be inserted into the collection:

overriddenHomer;

Final Answer
The answer to this Java challenger is B. The output would be:

true
false
