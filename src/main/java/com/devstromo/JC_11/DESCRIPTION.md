Let's analyze the code, in the first line:

`System.out.println(Jedi.class.getAnnotation(Table.class).name());`

The Table.class annotation will be picked without any problem since we have the @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) annotation declared on it:

`@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface Table { String name(); }`

In the next code line:
`System.out.println(Jedi.class.getAnnotation(Column.class).name());`

There are two reasons this code will throw a NullPointerException, the first one is that this annotation is not marked as RUNTIME:

`@interface Column { String name(); }`

The other one is that we should access the Column annotation through the fields and not in the class. The code would work if it was like this:

`Arrays.stream(Jedi.class.getDeclaredFields()).forEach(f -> {
if (f.getName().equals("attackType")) {
System.out.println(f.getAnnotation(Column.class).name());
}
});`

So the final output will be:
jedi
NullPointerException will be thrown
